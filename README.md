[![Run on repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/CryogenicPlanet/covid-resources)](https://repl.it/github/CryogenicPlanet/covid-resources}&ref=button)

This is a general repo not for any specific city but rather any city, fork this repo for other cities

There are lot of collections of valuable data but keeping it an open source place like this makes it much better to search and not duplicate.

# Getting Started

Set the variables in `.env.example` and move them to `.env.local`

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev # To run development mode of the server
```

# Cities

List of exisiting cities that have repository with data

# Cloning for other cities

This should ideally be cloned for every city with its own data, which makes it most useful. Maybe even for smaller communities within a city.

1. Fork this repo
2. Set all the enviroment variables in `.env.example`
3. Recommend using [repl.it](https://repl.it) for deployment
4. Add your repo and deployment link to the table above!

_Feel free to delete the `baseApp` folder in your forks or just leave it alone, it is just for the landing page._

## Enviorment Variables

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CITY_NAME` is the name of your city.

P.S : `NEX_PUBLIC_ENV` is just the way nextjs allows env variables to be accessible in the dom, nothing else.

### Captcha

Generate your captcha secrets [here](https://g.co/recaptcha/v3) using recaptha v2

1.  `CAPTCHA_SECRET` This is the captcha secret google give you
2.  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTHA_SITE_KEY` This is the captcha site key

### Git Integration

You can setup automatic git updates every hour by adding `WORKER_ACCOUNT`,`WORKER_PASSWORD` and `REPO_URL` to the `.env.local` file.

**For simplicity, please ensure `REPO_URL` does not have `https://` so it should be like `github.com/CryogenicPlanet/covid-bangalore-resources.git`**

While these can be the name and password of your main github account, I would recommend setting up a smurf account just for grunt work which can push these changes

### Adding your city to the list

1. Modify this `README.md` with the Cities table above and add your city
2. Modfiy `baseApp/cityData.ts` with your city, it an array of cities which are shaped like the following

```typescript
const city = {
  name: 'Bangalore',
  url: 'https://covid-bangalore-resources.cryogenicplanet.repl.co/',
  repo: 'https://github.com/CryogenicPlanet/covid-bangalore-resources',
  maintainer: {
    name: 'Rahul Tarak',
    url: 'https://twitter.com/CryogenicPlanet'
  }

```

3. Make a PR to this repo!

# Data

All the data is in the `_data` folder, everything else is just the client to display the data.

_This repository has no data itself, all the data will be in city specific repositories_

The idea with open sourcing the data is, this data can be used for more complex application which verifiy sources or such without having to worry about collecting the data again.

### Adding data programatically

The data is in the format of the following

```typescript
type DataType = {
  uuid: string // use a uuid library
  name: string
  description: string
  contact: string
  lastVerified: number // should be -1 by default
}
```

While adding them programatically, we can directly modify the `json` files inside the `_data` folder depending on the category.(Uncategorized should go into other). Each json files is structured like the following

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      // Object of DataType here
      // lastVerified should be set to -1 by default
      // uuid should ideally be a random unique id
    }
  ]
}
```

Any language can be used to programtically writing to these `json` files, I would recommend `python`. Once the data is written, just make a PR and I will merge it as soon as possible.
